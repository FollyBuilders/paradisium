# How To

## Bootstrap
LXStudio is built on top of [Processing](https://processing.org/) which uses [jogl](https://jogamp.org/jogl/www/) under the hood. As such, you need to run a small script which will symlink the native libraries into the appropriate location

```sh
$ bash bootstrap.sh
```

## How To

### Run LXStudio
```sh
$ ./gradlew run
```

# Develop
